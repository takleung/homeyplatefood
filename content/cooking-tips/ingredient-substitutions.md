## Dairy Substitutions

### Butter

| If Recipe Calls For | Substitute With | Ratio | Notes |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------|-------|
| **1 cup butter** | Coconut oil | 1:1 | Best for baking; adds subtle coconut flavor |

| **1 cup butter (baking)** | Applesauce | ½ cup | Healthier option; makes denser texture |
| **1 tbsp butter (sautéing)** | Olive oil | 1 tbsp | For savory dishes only |

**Pro Tip:** When substituting oil for butter in baking, add 1-2 tbsp extra liquid for proper moisture.

## Pro Tips for Successful Substitutions

### ✓ Do:
- Understand the ingredient's role (binding, leavening, flavor, moisture)
- Make one substitution at a time to test results
- Start with less of stronger-flavored substitutes
- Adjust cooking time and temperature as needed
- Keep notes on what works

### ✗ Don't:
- Substitute everything in a recipe at once
- Assume all substitutions are equal
- Use expired substitutes
- Skip testing in important dishes
- Substitute structural ingredients (eggs, flour) in complex baking

---

## When NOT to Substitute

Some ingredients are irreplaceable in certain recipes:

**Baking:**
- Cake flour in delicate cakes
- Eggs in soufflés, meringues, custards

**Cooking:**
- Saffron (too unique)
- Fresh herbs in herb-forward dishes
- Quality chocolate in chocolate desserts

**Rule:** If an ingredient is the star of the dish, don't substitute.
