# Essential Food Safety Guide

Food safety isn't optional—it's fundamental to good cooking. Follow these essential practices to protect yourself and your loved ones from foodborne illness.

---

## The Four Core Principles

### 1. CLEAN
**Prevent bacterial contamination through proper hygiene**

**Wash hands:**
- Before and after handling food
- After touching raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs
- After using the bathroom, touching pets, or blowing nose
- **Technique:** Scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds (sing "Happy Birthday" twice)

**Clean surfaces:**
- Wash cutting boards, countertops, and utensils with hot, soapy water
- Sanitize after contact with raw meat, poultry, or seafood
- Replace sponges weekly (they harbor bacteria)
- Wash dish towels in hot water frequently

**Rinse produce:**
- Wash all fruits and vegetables under running water
- Scrub firm produce (melons, potatoes) with clean brush
- Don't wash meat or poultry (spreads bacteria; cooking kills it)

---

### 2. SEPARATE
**Prevent cross-contamination**

**In the refrigerator:**
- Store raw meat, poultry, and seafood on bottom shelf (prevents dripping)
- Use sealed containers or plastic bags
- Keep ready-to-eat foods on upper shelves
- Separate produce drawer from meat

**During prep:**
- Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and produce
  - **Tip:** Red board = meat, Green board = vegetables (color coding helps)
- Never reuse marinades that touched raw meat
- Don't put cooked food back on plates that held raw meat
- Wash plates and utensils between raw and cooked food

**When shopping:**
- Separate raw meat from other groceries in cart
- Bag raw meat separately at checkout
- Put groceries away immediately (especially in hot weather)

### 3. COOK
**Heat food to safe internal temperatures**

### Safe Internal Temperatures

| Food Type | Safe Minimum Internal Temp | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------------|-------|
| **Poultry (chicken, turkey, duck)** | 165°F (74°C) | All parts, including ground |
| **Ground meats (beef, pork, lamb)** | 160°F (71°C) | Mix of different meats |
| **Beef, pork, lamb steaks/chops** | 145°F (63°C) + 3 min rest | Medium-rare to medium |
| **Fish & shellfish** | 145°F (63°C) | Until flesh is opaque and separates easily |
| **Eggs** | 160°F (71°C) | Cook until yolk and white are firm |
| **Leftovers & casseroles** | 165°F (74°C) | Reheat thoroughly |
| **Ham (precooked)** | 140°F (60°C) | If reheating only |
| **Ham (fresh, raw)** | 145°F (63°C) + 3 min rest | Cook fully |

**Essential tool:** Use a food thermometer—don't guess! Insert into thickest part of meat, away from bone.

### Cooking Tips
- Color is NOT a reliable indicator of doneness (use thermometer)
- Let meat rest after cooking—temperature continues to rise 5-10°F
- Bring sauces, soups, and gravies to a rolling boil when reheating
- Microwave food to 165°F, stir, and let stand 2 minutes

---

### 4. CHILL
**Refrigerate promptly to slow bacterial growth**

**The 2-Hour Rule:**
- Refrigerate perishable foods within **2 hours** of cooking or buying
- In hot weather (above 90°F), refrigerate within **1 hour**
- Bacteria multiply rapidly between 40°F and 140°F ("Danger Zone")

**Proper refrigeration:**
- Keep refrigerator at **40°F (4°C) or below**
- Keep freezer at **0°F (-18°C) or below**
- Use appliance thermometers to verify temperatures
- Don't overfill refrigerator (blocks airflow)

**Cooling hot foods:**
- Divide large amounts into shallow containers for faster cooling
- Don't wait for food to cool before refrigerating
- Place hot food directly in refrigerator (modern fridges handle this)
- Use ice bath for very large quantities

## Safe Food Storage Times

### Refrigerator Storage (40°F or below)

| Food | Maximum Storage | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Raw ground meat, poultry** | 1-2 days | Freeze if not using soon |
| **Raw steaks, chops, roasts** | 3-5 days | Keep in original packaging or rewrap |
| **Cooked meat or poultry** | 3-4 days | Store in airtight container |
| **Fresh fish** | 1-2 days | Use quickly or freeze |
| **Eggs (in shell)** | 3-5 weeks | Store in original carton |
| **Hard-boiled eggs** | 1 week | Peeled or unpeeled |
| **Lunch meats (opened)** | 3-5 days | Sealed packages last longer |
| **Pizza** | 3-4 days | Wrap well |
| **Soups & stews** | 3-4 days | Cool before storing |
| **Salad with dressing** | 1-2 days | Undressed lasts 3-5 days |
| **Cut fresh fruit** | 3-4 days | In airtight container |

### Freezer Storage (0°F or below)

| Food | Best Quality | Safe Indefinitely (at 0°F) |
|------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Ground meat** | 3-4 months | Yes, but quality declines |
| **Steaks, chops** | 4-12 months | Yes |
| **Whole chicken or turkey** | 1 year | Yes |
| **Chicken pieces** | 9 months | Yes |
| **Fish (fatty like salmon)** | 2-3 months | Yes |
| **Fish (lean like cod)** | 6-8 months | Yes |
| **Cooked meat dishes** | 2-3 months | Yes |
| **Soups & stews** | 2-3 months | Yes |
| **Bread, baked goods** | 2-3 months | Yes |

**Note:** "Safe indefinitely" means won't cause illness, but quality (flavor, texture) decreases over time.

## Thawing Food Safely

### ✓ SAFE Methods

**1. Refrigerator Thawing (Best method)**
- Slowest but safest
- Plan ahead: 24 hours per 5 lbs of food
- Place on plate to catch drips
- Can refreeze if still cold

**2. Cold Water Thawing**
- Submerge in leak-proof bag
- Change water every 30 minutes
- Cook immediately after thawing
- Small items: 1 hour; large roast: 2-3 hours per pound

**3. Microwave Thawing**
- Use defrost setting
- Cook immediately after thawing
- Some parts may start cooking during defrost

**4. Cook from Frozen**
- Safe for many foods (may take 50% longer)
- Works well for: frozen vegetables, chicken breasts, ground beef

### ✗ UNSAFE Methods

❌ **Counter thawing** — Bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature
❌ **Hot water thawing** — Promotes bacterial growth
❌ **Leaving in garage or basement** — Temperature fluctuates
