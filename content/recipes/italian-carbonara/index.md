### Detailed Instructions

#### 1. Prep Work
Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and **salt it generously** (it should taste like the sea). Cut the guanciale into **¼-inch thick strips or small cubes**. In a large bowl, whisk together the **egg yolks, whole eggs, and half the grated pecorino** until well combined. Add **1 tsp of freshly ground black pepper** to the egg mixture.

#### 2. Render the Guanciale
In a large, cold skillet, add the guanciale pieces. Turn heat to **medium-low** and cook for **8-10 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes **golden and crispy**. Do not drain the fat - you'll need it for the sauce.

#### 3. Cook the Pasta
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until **al dente** (usually 1-2 minutes less than package instructions). Reserve **1 cup of pasta cooking water** before draining.

#### 4. Combine with Guanciale
Turn off the heat under the guanciale skillet. Add the drained pasta directly to the skillet with the guanciale and fat. Toss well to coat the pasta. Let it cool for **1-2 minutes** (this is crucial - if too hot, eggs will scramble).

#### 5. Create the Sauce
Remove the skillet from heat completely. Add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, tossing constantly and vigorously. Add **pasta water 2-3 tablespoons at a time**, continuing to toss, until you achieve a **silky, creamy sauce** that coats the pasta (not soupy, not dry).

#### 6. Final Seasoning
Add the remaining pecorino and another **1 tsp of freshly ground black pepper**. Toss again. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed (usually no additional salt needed due to the guanciale and cheese).

#### 7. Plate and Serve
Serve immediately in warm bowls. Top with **extra pecorino** and a **generous grinding of black pepper**. The sauce should be glossy and coat each strand of pasta perfectly.

### Pro Tips

- **Temperature Control**: The key to creamy carbonara is temperature. The skillet should be warm but not hot when adding eggs.
- **No Cream**: Traditional carbonara never uses cream. The creaminess comes from the emulsion of eggs, cheese, and pasta water.
- **Pasta Water**: The starchy pasta water is essential for creating the silky sauce texture.
- **Work Quickly**: Once you start combining ingredients, work swiftly to maintain the right consistency.
