### Detailed Instructions

#### 1. Prep Work
Cut the chicken into **bite-sized pieces**. Prepare all vegetables: quarter the Thai eggplants, slice bamboo shoots, tear kaffir lime leaves (remove central vein), and cut green beans if using. **Separate the thick coconut cream from the top of one can** (about ½ cup).

#### 2. Fry the Curry Paste
Heat a large wok or deep pan over **medium-high heat**. Add **2 tbsp oil** and the thick coconut cream you separated. Stir-fry for **2-3 minutes** until oil separates and becomes fragrant. Add the **green curry paste** and fry for **2-3 minutes**, stirring constantly until very aromatic and the oil turns green.

#### 3. Add Chicken
Add the chicken pieces to the curry paste. Stir-fry for **3-4 minutes** until the chicken is sealed and coated with the paste (doesn't need to be fully cooked).

#### 4. Add Coconut Milk
Pour in the **remaining coconut milk** (about 1.5 cans total). Stir well to combine. Bring to a **gentle boil**, then reduce to a simmer.

#### 5. Add Vegetables
Add the **eggplants, bamboo shoots, and kaffir lime leaves**. Simmer for **8-10 minutes** until vegetables are tender. If using green beans, add them in the last **5 minutes** of cooking.

#### 6. Season
Add **fish sauce** (start with 2 tbsp) and **palm sugar** (start with 1 tbsp). Taste and adjust - it should be balanced between salty, sweet, and spicy. Add more fish sauce for saltiness, sugar for sweetness, or curry paste for heat.

#### 7. Final Touch
Add the **Thai basil leaves** and sliced red chilies (if using). Stir for **30 seconds** until basil is just wilted. Turn off heat immediately.

#### 8. Serve
Serve hot over **jasmine rice**. The curry should be aromatic, creamy, with a beautiful green color and a perfect balance of flavors.

### Pro Tips

- **Coconut Cream Trick**: Frying curry paste in coconut cream (not milk) creates better flavor than using oil alone.
- **Thai Eggplant**: These small, round eggplants are traditional but Japanese eggplant works well too.
- **Spice Level**: Adjust curry paste amount to your preference. 3 tbsp is medium-hot, 4+ tbsp is very spicy.
- **Make Ahead**: Curry tastes even better the next day as flavors meld. Store in refrigerator for up to 3 days.
- **Protein Swap**: Substitute chicken with shrimp, tofu, or mixed vegetables for variety.
