### Detailed Instructions

#### 1. Prepare the Teriyaki Sauce
In a small saucepan, combine **soy sauce, mirin, sake, brown sugar, and honey**. Add the **grated ginger and minced garlic**. Bring to a **gentle simmer** over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves completely. Let it simmer for **5-6 minutes** until slightly reduced. Add the **cornstarch slurry** (cornstarch mixed with water), stir well, and cook for **1 more minute** until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy. Remove from heat and set aside.

#### 2. Prep the Salmon
Pat the salmon fillets **completely dry** with paper towels (this ensures crispy skin). Season both sides with **salt and pepper**. Let sit at room temperature for **5 minutes**.

#### 3. Sear the Salmon (Skin Side)
Heat a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet over **medium-high heat**. Add **1 tbsp vegetable oil**. When the oil is shimmering, place salmon fillets **skin-side down**. Press gently with a spatula for **10 seconds** to prevent curling. Cook for **4-5 minutes** without moving until the skin is **crispy and golden**.

#### 4. Flip and Cook
Carefully flip the salmon fillets. Cook the flesh side for **2-3 minutes** for medium doneness (salmon should be slightly pink in the center and reach 125-130°F internal temperature).

#### 5. Glaze the Salmon
Reduce heat to **medium-low**. Pour the **teriyaki sauce** over the salmon fillets in the pan. Spoon the sauce over the fish repeatedly for **1-2 minutes**, allowing it to caramelize and create a beautiful glaze. The sauce should coat the salmon and become thick and sticky.

#### 6. Rest and Serve
Remove from heat. Let the salmon rest in the pan for **1 minute**. Transfer to serving plates. Spoon any remaining glaze from the pan over the top. Garnish with **sesame seeds and sliced green onions**.

#### 7. Serving Suggestions
Serve immediately with **steamed white rice, stir-fried vegetables, or a fresh Asian slaw**. Drizzle extra teriyaki sauce over rice if desired.

### Pro Tips

- **Crispy Skin**: The secret is dry salmon and a hot pan. Don't move the fish while searing skin-side.
- **Doneness**: For medium-rare (preferred), cook skin-side for 4-5 minutes and flesh-side for 2 minutes. For well-done, add 1-2 minutes per side.
- **Make-Ahead Sauce**: Teriyaki sauce can be made up to 1 week ahead and stored in the refrigerator. Reheat gently before using.
- **Sauce Thickness**: If sauce is too thick, thin with water or more mirin. If too thin, simmer longer or add more cornstarch slurry.
- **Variations**: This teriyaki sauce works beautifully with chicken thighs, tofu, or grilled vegetables.
