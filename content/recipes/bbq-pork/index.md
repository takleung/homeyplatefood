### Detailed Instructions

#### 1. Prep Work
**Cut the pork shoulder into thick strips.** Pat the pork completely dry.

#### 2. Initial Cook (Marinade 1)
In a bowl, mix **2 tbsp of the Lobo Roast Red Pork Seasoning Mix** with enough **water to fully cover** the pork strips. Submerge the pork and marinate for **3 hours**.

#### 3. Adding Mains (Marinade 2)
Remove the pork from the liquid Lobo marinade and **pat it dry**. Rub the entire surface of the pork with just **2–3 tbsp of the Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Sauce**. Marinate for an additional **2 hours**.

#### 4. Mixing (First Bake Prep)
Preheat your oven or air fryer to **180°C or 360°F**. Tightly wrap the marinated pork in a sheet of aluminum foil.

#### 5. Sauce/Seasoning (Bake Stage 1)
Place the wrapped pork into the preheated oven/air fryer and bake for **15 minutes**.

#### 6. Simmer/Cover (Bake Stage 2)
Take the pork out. Carefully unwrap the foil, flip the pork upside down, re-cover it, and put it back in the oven/air fryer for an extra **15 minutes at 180°C or 360°F**.

#### 7. Final Checks (Glaze Prep)
Take the pork out and remove the foil. Increase the oven/air fryer temperature to **200°C**. Brush the pork generously with the Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Sauce and a drizzle of syrup (the first glaze layer).

#### 8. Glaze Bake (Stage 1)
Put the glazed pork back into the **200°C oven/air fryer** and bake for **5 minutes** to set the glaze on the first side. Take it out, flip, and apply a final generous layer of Char Siu Sauce and syrup. Bake for another **5–6 minutes** until the glaze is dark, sticky, and caramelized.

#### 9. Final Glaze & Slice
Let rest for **5 minutes**, slice, and serve hot.
